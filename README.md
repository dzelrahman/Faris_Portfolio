# My Data Science Portfolio
List of all my data science projects

# [Project 1: Rice Field Predictor](https://github.com/dzelrahman/RiceFieldPredictor "Project Repo")
* The objective is to determine rice field proportion and location that covers particular region in Indonesia, which in this project is Banyuwangi
* Use object detection algorithm (Single Shot Multibox Detector) to achieve those objectives.
* Use ArcGIS pro to label each object into four classes that constitutes satellite raster imagery 
* Use ArcGIS pro to augment and pre-process the image data to make it compatible for model fitting and training. 
* Use python module named arcgis.learn which is included in ArcGIS pro built in python module to build SSD model algorithm.
* This project is already written in [essay form](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/rice-field-predictor-727b03eeffee) that is published in Analytics Vidhya's Medium page where I create a story that explains the working process and steps I took in building this project, starting from data collection until model evaluation.

# [Project 2: Covid-19 Analysis and Prediction](https://github.com/dzelrahman/Covid19AnalysisPrediction "Project Repo")
* This project is made when Covid-19 pandemic was still in early phase, thus the data is still limited and cannot be used as real guidelines.
* The objective is just to do simple data exploration and visualization using Covid-19 case data that had been published by John Hopkins University.
* Data visualization is generated to know the number of Case Fatality Rate and Recovery Rate through using GGPLOT, the well known R-package for creating compelling data visualization. 
* Prediction modeling is done by using FB Prophet machine learning algorithm to know the number of cases and death in the extend of next month, assuming that the growth rate has exponential nature. 
* This project is already written in [essay form](https://medium.com/@dzelrahman/analisa-dan-prediksi-covid-19-f706cac9786e) that is published in my personal Medium page where I create a story that explains the working process and steps I took in building this project, starting from data collection until model evaluation. I use my mother language here.
