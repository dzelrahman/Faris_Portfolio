List of all my data science projects

# [Project 1: Rice Field Predictor](https://github.com/dzelrahman/RiceFieldPredictor "Project Repo")
* The objective is to determine rice field proportion and location that covers particular region in Indonesia, which in this project is Banyuwangi
* Use object detection algorithm (Single Shot Multibox Detector) to achieve those objectives.
* Use ArcGIS pro to label each object into four classes that constitutes satellite raster imagery 
* Use ArcGIS pro to augment and pre-process the image data to make it compatible for model fitting and training. 
* Use python module named arcgis.learn which is included in ArcGIS pro built in python module to build SSD model algorithm.
